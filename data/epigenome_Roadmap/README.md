The main site to visit for epigenome roadmap data is: http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/  

The segmentation files are downloaded from http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/chromhmmSegmentations/ChmmModels/coreMarks/jointModel/final/

The meta data annotation file was downloaded from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yikGx4MsO9Ei36b64yOy9Vb6oPC5IBGlFbYEt-N6gOM/edit#gid=15
I converted it to a tsv file `Consolidated_EpigenomeIDs_summary_Table.tsv`. The file is still not tidy, but can serve as a good start point.
